Don't give me that sucker-fish shit
Your love life ain't that hurting
And you always seemed to get what you
Wanted without flirting

You're not the only one
Who's used to playing dirty
And all I ever wanted from you
Is to leave me alone

So don't give me that sucker-fish shit
'Cause I'm not that strong a swimmer
But I'm not afraid to be moving
In a slower river

You're not the only one
Who used to watch Speed Racer

The very first car
In a race around the world
Is somewhere in the middle
Of a race around the circle

And the very first car
In a race around the world
Has got to wipe out somewhere
But that somewhere isn't me

So don't give me that sucker-fish shit
'Cause I'm not getting younger
And I'm not a floatable
To keep you from going under

And you're not the only one
Who used to watch Speed Racer

The very first car
In a race around the world
Is somewhere in the middle
Of a race around the circle

And the very first car
In a race around the world
Has got to wipe out somewhere
But that somewhere isn't me
