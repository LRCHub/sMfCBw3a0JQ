From the top you can see so far into the distance.
Look, it's downhill all the way from here.
And getting there is quicker, let go and you just slide.
Shouldn't take more than a year.

And I could almost like you,
Now it's nearly over,
Now you've shown some weakness,
Now you're looking older.

And I heard what you said,
And I recognised those feelings.
I know how hard it is to watch it go.
And all the effort that it took to get here in the first place
And all the effort not to let the effort show.

And I could almost like you
Now you're falling over.
Now you're feeling hopeless,
Now you're looking over your shoulder.

If you can ride the backlash
There's still time for a comeback.
You don't have to lie down and die.
But Lazarus he only did it just the one time -
He couldn't face another try.

And I could almost like you
Now its really over,
Now you've shown some weakness
Now you're looking over your shoulder.

Who's gonna come find you?
Who's gonna come find you?
Who's gonna come find you?
